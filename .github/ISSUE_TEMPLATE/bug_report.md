<!--
Please note the following:

1. **Update Luanti to the latest stable or dev version** before submitting a bug report. Make sure the bug is still reproducible on the latest version.
2. This page is for reporting the bugs of **the engine itself**. For bugs in a particular game, please [search for the game on ContentDB](https://content.luanti.org/packages/?type=game) and submit a bug report to its developers.
    * For example, issues about Minetest Game are submitted to [its own repository](https://github.com/luanti-org/minetest_game/issues).
3. Please provide as many relevant details as possible.
4. If you have used an LLM/AI to format your issue description, disclose this. Try to keep it concise. No walls of text please.

Attaching a copy of your `debug.txt` and `minetest.conf` can be helpful as well.
-->

##### Steps to reproduce
<!--
Explain how the problem has happened.

To the extent possible, the reproduction steps should describe not just what you did (e.g. "I open my world and it crashes")
but be detailed enough so that anyone with a fresh installation of Luanti could follow these steps to encounter the same problem.
In case of modding issues it is often useful to include a code snippet.
This will help us diagnose the problem quicker and more efficiently. Thank you.
